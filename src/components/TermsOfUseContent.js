        obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, debts, and expenses (including
        but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use, misuse

        asserting any available defense. You agree not to settle any matter
        subject to an indemnification by you without first obtaining our prior
        express written approval.

        effect while most nearly adhering to the intent expressed herein, (h)
        you may not assign or transfer these Terms (including all rights and
